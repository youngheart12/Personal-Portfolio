import Underlining from "../../../src/styles/underlining"

Born in 1998, I grew up in the midst of the digital rise. As a teenager I was more into computers, spending time exploring how things are working, and soon my eagerness to know how apps and websites are built took me to learnÂ to program.

After school, I started to study <Underlining highlight>Computer Science & Engineering as a bachelor's degree</Underlining> at the University of Lovely Professional University, Punjab. There, I learnd everything
about how to launch, develop, and market a digital business and web apps. Moreover, I was lucky enough to work as a Co-Ceo in an organization called WISSEN which operates under the Division of Student Welfare. Besides studying,
I also worked as a <Underlining highlight>Campus Editor for LinkedIn </Underlining>.

Currently, I work as a <Underlining highlight>Frontend Engineer</Underlining> at <a href="https://innovaccer.com/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" aria-label="External Link">Innovaccer</a>.
